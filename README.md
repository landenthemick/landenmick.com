# Personal Website

This is a more indepth asewll as the latest rendition of my personal webiste. I didnâ€™t want to deal with components, routers, boilerplates.
Local dev workflows are nice, but it depends on how often you'd envision updating this site. For me, it wasn't very frequent.
I aimed for a clean and simple theme, I enjoy tinkering with themes, but I just wanted to manipulate a couple of simple css rules and be on my way. 

This reposititory will be updated frequently with new tweaks and changes.
